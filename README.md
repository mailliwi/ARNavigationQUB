# Augmented Reality Navigation.
This project springs from my desire to create a mobile GPS application in Augmented Reality for iPhone.
By being more visual, this application helps people better see where to go and when to turn.

For the people that are comfortable with looking at a 2D map on a screen, translating 2D directions to their real world environment is a sufficient form of navigation help. For others like Bobby, our fictional user, it is not enough.

Bobby has trouble with directions, despite having access to his mobile phone mapping application. His grandmother has moved into a new house, and Bobby decides to pay her a visit. While on his way to her new home, he gets confused; the GPS tells him to turn left, but as there are several consecutive roads to his left, it makes it difficult for him to know exactly which one is the correct one. Bobby would prefer if the instructions were more visual as this would eliminate any confusion. He would rather see the world around him as it is and have his directions superimposed on a live video feed.

The aim of this project is to create an application that would solve this problem through the use of augmented reality, and stems from the increasing presence of this specific technology.

## How

The main components of this project are [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for its excellent mapping and navigation tools, [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) for its native iOS AR technology, and a couple of other [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) libraries.
